# Assignment for Candidates

This repository contains the assignment for candidates applying for a **Software Engineer MERN** position in our company **The Web Hunter**. The assignment consists of two problems described below.

## Problem 1: Website Performance

The website for a product you are working on currently takes a long time to load. Describe the steps you would take to diagnose and fix this performance issue.

### Requirements

The response should include a detailed explanation of the steps you would take to diagnose and fix the performance issue.

### Evaluation Criteria

The thoroughness and clarity of the explanation of the steps taken to diagnose and fix the performance issue.

## Problem 2: React Higher Order Component

In this coding task, you will be implementing a Higher Order Component (HOC) that adds a loading indicator to a given component. The incomplete code for the component you will be working on is located in the `src` folder, which includes a `codingtask` folder containing the `Component.js` file.

Your task is to create a HOC that wraps around `Component` and displays a loading indicator while the data for the component is being fetched. The HOC should have the following requirements:

- The HOC should accept a `loading` prop that will determine whether to show the loading indicator or not.
- The HOC should make a fake API call to simulate fetching data, which should take 2 seconds to complete.
- While the data is being fetched, the HOC should display a loading indicator.
- Once the data has been fetched, the HOC should pass it down to the `Component` as a prop.
- The HOC should be reusable and work with any component.

You can use any libraries or tools you like to implement the HOC. Please make sure to complete the code in the `Component.js` file and submit your solution in a compressed folder.

Good luck!
